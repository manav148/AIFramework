# Project Rules and Best Practices for Bootstrapping

## BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Testing

1. BDD Test Implementation
   - When bootstrapping a new project, implement BDD tests to describe the behavior of the system.
   - Use a BDD framework appropriate for your project's language (e.g., Cucumber for Ruby, Behave for Python, or Jest for JavaScript).

2. Feature Files
   - Create feature files using Gherkin syntax to describe the expected behavior of the system.
   - Write scenarios in a "Given-When-Then" format to clearly define the context, action, and expected outcome.

3. Step Definitions
   - Implement step definitions that map to the steps in your feature files.
   - Ensure step definitions are reusable and maintainable.

4. Continuous Integration
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines to run BDD tests automatically on each commit or pull request.

## Other Best Practices for Bootstrapping

1. Project Structure
   - Set up a clear and logical project structure from the beginning.
   - Follow language-specific conventions and best practices for directory structure.

2. Version Control
   - Initialize a Git repository at the start of the project.
   - Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

3. Dependency Management
   - Set up a dependency management system appropriate for your project (e.g., npm for JavaScript, pip for Python).
   - Create a file to list and lock dependencies (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt).

4. Configuration Management
   - Implement environment-based configuration management.
   - Use environment variables or configuration files for different environments (development, staging, production).

5. Documentation
   - Start with a comprehensive README.md file explaining project setup and basic usage.
   - Set up auto-generation of API documentation if applicable.

6. Linting and Code Formatting
   - Implement a linter appropriate for your project's language.
   - Set up an auto-formatter to ensure consistent code style across the project.

7. Containerization
   - Consider setting up Docker for consistent development and deployment environments.

8. Logging and Monitoring
   - Implement a logging system from the start.
   - Set up basic monitoring and alerting if applicable.

9. Security
   - Implement security best practices from the beginning (e.g., input validation, authentication, authorization).
   - Set up security scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline.

10. Performance Considerations
    - Implement performance testing from the early stages.
    - Set up tools for profiling and monitoring application performance.

Remember to adapt these practices based on the specific needs and context of your project. Regularly review and update these practices as the project evolves.
