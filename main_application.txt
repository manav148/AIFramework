# Main Application

This file contains the main application code for your AI software. Implement your features here following the TDD process and adhering to the best practices outlined in the framework.

## Import Statements

[LLM: Add necessary import statements here as you develop your application]

## Constants and Configuration

[LLM: Define any constants or configuration variables here]

## Main Application Class or Functions

[LLM: Implement your main application logic here. Use comments to explain complex logic and reference related test cases]

class MyAIApplication:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize your AI application
        pass

    def process_data(self, input_data):
        # Implement data processing logic
        pass

    def train_model(self, training_data):
        # Implement model training logic
        pass

    def make_prediction(self, input_features):
        # Implement prediction logic
        pass

## Helper Functions

[LLM: Implement any helper functions or utility methods here]

def preprocess_data(raw_data):
    # Implement data preprocessing logic
    pass

def evaluate_model(model, test_data):
    # Implement model evaluation logic
    pass

## Main Execution

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Main execution logic
    app = MyAIApplication()
    # Add code to run your application

Remember to update this file as you implement new features, always following the TDD process and ensuring that all tests pass before and after making changes.
