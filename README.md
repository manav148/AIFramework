# LLM and Project Rules Package

## Purpose

This package provides a comprehensive set of rules and best practices for software development projects, with a focus on Large Language Model (LLM) applications and project bootstrapping. It aims to establish a solid foundation for building robust, maintainable, and efficient software systems.

## Contents

1. `task_rules.md`: This file outlines the general rules and best practices for software development. It covers:
   - Major points such as regression testing, unit testing, and file size limits.
   - Best coding practices including code readability, DRY principle, SOLID principles, error handling, security, and performance optimization.
   - File structure guidelines for organizing your project effectively.

2. `project_rules.md`: This file focuses on rules and best practices specifically for bootstrapping new projects. It includes:
   - Guidelines for implementing Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tests.
   - Best practices for project setup, including version control, dependency management, configuration management, documentation, linting, containerization, logging, security, and performance considerations.

## How to Use

1. When starting a new project, refer to both `task_rules.md` and `project_rules.md` to ensure you're following best practices from the outset.
2. For ongoing development, regularly consult `task_rules.md` to maintain code quality and project structure.
3. Use these guidelines as a starting point and adapt them as necessary to fit the specific needs of your project and team.

By following these rules and best practices, you can improve code quality, maintainability, and efficiency in your software development projects, particularly those involving LLMs or other complex systems.

Remember, these are guidelines and best practices. Always use your judgment and adapt these rules as necessary for your specific project requirements and team dynamics.
