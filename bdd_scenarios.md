# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Scenarios

Use this file to write BDD scenarios for your AI software. Follow the Given-When-Then format for each scenario.

## Example Scenario

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication

Scenario: Successful login
  Given the user is on the login page
  When they enter valid credentials
  And they click the login button
  Then they should be redirected to the dashboard

Scenario: Failed login
  Given the user is on the login page
  When they enter invalid credentials
  And they click the login button
  Then they should see an error message
```

## Your Scenarios

[LLM: Replace this section with your actual BDD scenarios. Each new feature should have its own set of scenarios. Ensure that the scenarios cover all expected behaviors and edge cases.]

Feature: [Feature Name]

Scenario: [Scenario Name]
  Given [precondition]
  When [action]
  Then [expected result]

[Add more scenarios as needed]

Remember to update this file with new scenarios before implementing any new features or making changes to existing ones.
